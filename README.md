Q. (Total Sales) :
1) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem:
A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different
products (1 to 5).
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of
product sold.
   
2) Each slip contains the following:
a) The salesperson number
b) The product number
c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
   
3) Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per
day. Assume that the information from all the slips for last
month is available.
   
4) Write an application that will read all this information for
last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson
and by product. All totals should be stored in the two-
dimensional array sales. After processing all the information
for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each
column representing a salesperson and each row representing a
particular product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales
of each product for last month.
   
5) Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson
for last month. Your output should include these cross-totals to
the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled
columns.
